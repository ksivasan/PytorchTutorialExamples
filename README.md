# PytorchTutorialExamples
My work on replicating some of the tutorials. I strike to understand the basics, go through the underlying parts and see for myself what makes it work. There is little to no innovation but a load of learning which I try to document during the process. It also helps me to keep myself updated of the literature, frameworks, software organization structure etc. 

Since most of the time I find it hard to follow when there are multiple imports, I try to keep only standard imports and rest on same file. This way each python file an run on it's own when downloaded.
