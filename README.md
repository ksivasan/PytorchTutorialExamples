# PytorchTutorialExamples
My work on replicating some of the tutorials. I strike to understand the basics, go through the underlying parts and see for myself what makes it work. There is little to no innovation but a load of learning which I try to document during the process. It also helps me to keep myself updated of the literature, frameworks, software organization structure etc. 

Since most of the time I find it hard to follow when there are multiple imports, I try to keep only standard imports and rest on same file. This way each python file an run on it's own when downloaded. 

Note: This is replicative work and there are better implementations and tutorials out there. I welcome you to look at my way of doing but take it with a bit of salt. Also, I try to give acknowledgements to the people who inspired me & whose work I try to emulate. If I failed to quote someone, remember this is a side hustle where perfection is not my goal and nothing is intentional. I will correct myself if you point out.
